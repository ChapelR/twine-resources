# Twine Resources

This is a collection of resources and tools for use with [Twine](https://twinery.org/), an "open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories." The name "Twine" can refer to several different things: one of two applications, the type of story or game you make (e.g., a "Twine game"), and it often refers to the entire ecosystem of compilers, story formats, and tools designed together to make said stories.

> [!NOTE]
> In this guide, when we refer to **Twine**, we will generally be talking about the entire ecosystem. If we mean the genre of IF that Twine produces, we will use the term ["CYOA"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook), and if we are talking about one of the Twine applications, we will say "Twine 1" or "Twine 2."

> [!TIP]
> If you have or know of resources that you'd like to see in this guide, open an issue or a pull request. Note that this list is *curated*, so if I have reservations about a resource or if it does not appear to work, I reserve the right to deny it.

## Compilers

A Twine *compiler* refers to a program that takes your raw code and metadata: passage names, tags, source code, etc, and compiles it with a [story format](#story-formats) to generate a Twine game. There are two main types of compilers: [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) comilers and [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) compilers. Most beginners may prefer to use GUI compilers, as they more readily reflect the way most users interact with their computers, but CLI comilers typically offer more options and flexibility.

There are also two *generations* of Twine compilers and story formats. First generation Twine compilers typically only work with first generation story formats, and second generation compilers typically only work with second generation formats. However, there is at least one compiler and a handful of story formats that work with across these generations.

> [!NOTE]
> The term "generation" is, to my knowledge, an invention of this guide, not an official or widely accepted term.

|Generation|Compilers|Story Formats|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|Twine 1, Twee, Tweego|SugarCube, Sugarcane, Jonah, Snowman|
|**2**|Twine 2, Twee2, Extwee, Tweego|SugarCube, Snowman, Harlowe|

\*Note: the above table is not exhaustive.

### Twine 2

- [Website](https://twinery.org/)
- [Use Online](https://twinery.org/2)
- [Releases](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/releases)
- [Repository](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs)

The currently maintained Twine GUI application. The recommended GUI compiler for most users.

### Twine 1

- [Website](https://twinery.org/)
- [Repository](https://github.com/tweecode)

The old, unmaintained Twine GUI. Only recommended for use with generation 2 formats that also support this compiler (e.g., SugarCube). The old formats that come with Twine 1 should no longer be used, especially for new projects.

### Tweego

- [Website](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
- [Documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/docs)
- [Repository](https://bitbucket.org/tmedwards/tweego)

A CLI compiler for [Twee](https://twinery.org/cookbook/terms/terms_twee.html); works with formats from either generation. The recommended CLI compiler for most users. 

### Twee2

- [Website](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/)
- [Documentation](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/documentation.html)
- [Repository](https://github.com/Dan-Q/twee2)

Another CLI compiler. Works with Twine 2-style formats. Has slightly better interoperability with Twine 2 thanks to allowing for positional notation in the passage metadata, but its particular brand of Twee notation is not supported by any other compilers or tools.

### Extwee

- [Repository](https://github.com/videlais/extwee)

Another CLI compiler designed to work with second generation formats. Adheres to the [Twee3 specification](https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md).

### Twee

- [Documentation](http://twee-twine-doc.tiddlyspot.com/)
- [Repository](https://github.com/tweecode/twee) 

The original CLI compiler for Twee. No longer maintained and not recommended for use by anyone anymore. 

## Story Formats

A [**story format**](https://twinery.org/cookbook/introduction/story_formats.html) is the run-time engine for your Twine game. This choice is very important to how you'll approach development, what sort of features your game will have, and the way you'll write your code. A Twine or Twee compiler combines your source code, passages, and metadata with a story format to generate a complete, playable game.

### Core Formats

The "core" formats are the ones included with the Twine 2 application. These formats are still developed by third parties, but are more widely used, and typically better maintained, than other formats. The core formats are SugarCube, Harlowe, and Snowman. When using *any* format, you should always use the most recent possible version; older versions of formats are *only* included for compatibility with on-going projects and are not intended for use with new stories or games. <!-- wait to mention chapbook until it's out and in the core -->

#### SugarCube

- [Website](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/)
- [Documentation](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/)
- [Repository](https://bitbucket.org/tmedwards/sugarcube/)

SugarCube is a feature-rich, extensible, and simple story format. While in a few ways more complicated than Harlowe, SugarCube is still intended for beginners, but also comes with a variety of features and options for more advanced users as well. When choosing a format, **SugarCube is hard to go wrong with**. It may not always be the best fit, but it can always be adapted to work with whatever you have in mind.

#### Harlowe

- [Documentation](https://twine2.neocities.org/)
- [Repository](https://bitbucket.org/_L_/harlowe/)

Harlowe is a format designed for novices and is ideal for CYOA games with some dynamic content. If you want to build something more complex, like turn-based combat or inventory systems, Harlowe is generally not recommended. While simpler that SugarCube, Harlowe provides almost no options for extensibility; the core feature-set is largely all you have to work with. **Harlowe is ideal for authors who aren't looking to learn a lot about programming and just want to make a game**.

#### Snowman

- [Repository](https://github.com/videlais/snowman)

Snowman is essentially just a link markup parser, a markdown parser, and a templating engine, with a few nuts-and-bolts APIs built in to handle passages and such. It is agressively minimal, requiring authors to build almost every bit of funcitonality they may need in JavaScript. **Snowman requires a great deal of knowledge of JavaScript (and general web development) to get anywhere with**. Even then, its thin feature set may still make it a poorer choice than the other core formats for many projects.

### Proofing and Utility Formats

Twine 2 introduced the concept of "proofing" formats; story formats designed to create more readable copies of your source code for proofreading and editing. Utility formats is a related concept that sprung up from the community in the wake of proofing formats--typically these formats output Twine stories to some other useful format--JSON or Twee, for example, but there are many that do many cool things.

The default proofing format is [*Paperthin*](https://github.com/klembot/paperthin); it just shows your Twine file as a simple list of passage names and passage source code. Some community developed proofing formats, like [*Illume*](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/) arrived later. <!-- probably shouldn't mention poof, as it will look like I'm plugging, even though I think it's a good alternative to Illume, if I do say so myself --> Examples of utility formats include [*Entwee*](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/entwee/) and [*Enscree*](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/enscree/).

### Other Formats

Many, many story formats exist. A catalogue of formats can be found [here](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/hyperfic/twine/catalog/), courtesy of [M. C. DeMarco](http://mcdemarco.net/). Many of these formats may not work, may be incomplete, or may not have ever been released, however. This list is *probably* not exhaustive, given that potentially thousands of bespoke and custom formats could exist across the web, just waiting to be discovered, but it is by far the best list of its kind.

#### Some Formats of Note

The following is a list of some third-party story formats that have been confirmed to work and are actively maintained.

##### Entwee

- [Website](http://www.mcdemarco.net/tools/entwee/)

Entwee is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into the old twee format, based on Michael McCollumâ€™s similar story format, Entweedle. By M. C. DeMarco.

##### Enscree

- [Website](http://www.mcdemarco.net/tools/enscree/)

Enscree is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into a MultiMarkdown format used for importing into Scrivener/Scree. By M. C. DeMarco.

##### Paloma

- [Website](http://www.mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/)

A Snowman-based story format that features stretch-text--that is, new passages are rendered below the old ones, rather than replacing them. By M. C. DeMarco.

##### Adventures

- [Website](http://adventures.longwelwind.net/)

Adventures is a custom story format for Twine 2 made by Longwelwind that allows writers to add RPG elements such as health, items, golds and more to their story. 

##### Illume

- [Website](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/)

Illume is an experiment in producing a proofing format for Twine 2 that offers more functionality than a simple text dump. It includes several features, such as generating basic story statistics and the option to export your story in twee source format, but its primary purpose is to provide an interface for reviewing and editing passages in a workflow that allows an author to easily have another person, even someone who does not use Twine, proofread and provide edits to a story.

##### DotGraph

- [Website](http://www.mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/dotgraph/)

DotGraph is a proofing format that uses a JavaScript implementation of Graphviz to automatically lay out a Twine story as a layered graph. By M. C. DeMarco.

## Tooling

"Tooling" is essentially any program or software that helps you make Twine stories that isn't a requirement (like a format or a compiler) and doesn't go on to become part of your game (like a library or script). A few of these tools are not designed *specifically* or *only* for Twine.

## Extensions and Libraries

Since a great deal of web libraries can be made to work with Twine story formats (though it may take some doing), and since Snowman essentially requires *all* functionality to be built by author and I'm unaware of any specific libraries designed for it, this list will only include libraries, scripts, and extensions designed specifically to work with either Harlowe or SugarCube, at least for now.

SugarCube is more extensible than Harlowe, so typically has more scripts and extentions.

## Guides, Examples, and References

Guides for Twine can sometimes be hard to find when you need them, particularly because most guides, by necessity, are format-specific. Here are a few guides from across the web. There are other guides out there too, but many are out-of-date, written for older or defunct versions of Twine or story formats, or are (no disrespect intended to the original authors) simply wrong--so YMMV.

### General

Guides for the Twine application itself, for general Twine development information, or cover a lot of different story formats.

#### The Twine Cookbook

- [Website](https://twinery.org/cookbook/)

A "cookbook" featuring code examples and explanations of common use-cases in several different formats. A great place to start learning Twine.

#### The Twine Forum Archive

- [Website](https://twinery.org/forum/)

Years upon years of wisdom and answers can be found by searching the old forum archive. Typically, the archive will appear in Google searched, so it's more common to find it there then to comb through the archive itself.

#### The Official Twine Wiki

- [Website](https://twinery.org/wiki/)

This wiki is useful, but also has a mix of Twine 1 and Twine 2 content, and a mix of content regarding different story formats. This unfortunately can sometimes make it hard to tell what the information you're reading *is actually for*. Still, the wiki remains an impressive collection of information, and is typically worth exploring when you have questions that aren't specifically about a story format.

#### Videlais's Guides and Videos

- [Tutorials](https://videlais.com/twine-tutorials/)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTWJzxNdsIDHiYzGh-2Fd1w)

Videlais (aka, Dan Cox), a member of the Twine Committee and community, has produced many guides, videos, and explanations for all of the core story formats and for Twine in general.

### SugarCube

#### Official Documentation

- [Website](https://motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/)

The official documentation for SugarCube. While it includes some guides and tips, the documentation is intended as a reference, so may not always explain certain things in the level of detail required by a novice.

#### HiEv's SugarCube Sample Code

- [Website](https://qjzhvmqlzvoo5lqnrvuhmg-on.drv.tw/UInv/Sample_Code.html)

A large amount of sample code for SugarCube covering a variety of common and uncommon use-cases. Frequently updated with new samples.

### Harlowe

#### Official Documentation

- [Website](https://twine2.neocities.org/)

Harlowe's official documentation. Like SugarCube's docs, this is primarily a reference, though it does try to provide a lot of ground-floor explanations and examples to help novices understand.

### Snowman

#### The Twine Wiki Section on Snowman

- [Wiki Section](https://twinery.org/wiki/snowman:markup)

Snowman doens't have detailed documentation available anywhere (thought the source code is well-commented and not terribly long), but it does have a very detailed section in the Twine wiki that covers most of its APIs and features.
